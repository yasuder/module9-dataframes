### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)

# What was the 2015 salary of employee 57
salaries$salaries.2015[employees == "Employee 57"]

# How many employees got a raise?
number.raise <- length(salaries$got.raise[salaries$got.raise == TRUE])

# What was the value of the highest raise?
max.raise <- max(salaries$raise)

# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?
max.raise.emp <- salaries$employees[salaries$raise == max.raise]

# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?
min.raise <- min(salaries$raise)

# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?
min.raise.emp <- salaries$employees[salaries$raise == min.raise]

# What was the average salary increase?
avg.raise <- mean(salaries$raise)

### Bonus ###

# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?


# Is that what you expected them to lose based on how you generated their salaries?
